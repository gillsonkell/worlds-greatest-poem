In the realm of elements and lore so wide,  
Three entities in balance stride.  
Sodium chloride, with its crystal grace,  
Seasoning life, a familiar embrace.

Chlorine, fierce with a potent sting,  
Purifies waters, an unseen king.  
Both born of nature, yet distinct in role,  
One brings flavor, the other controls.

Midichlorians, from a galaxy far,  
Bridge life and Force, a guiding star.  
Not of this earth, but in every cell,  
They whisper secrets, a mystical spell.

Though different realms they each reside,  
In their essence, connections abide.  
Elements and myths, diverse yet aligned,  
In the fabric of life, their threads entwined.
