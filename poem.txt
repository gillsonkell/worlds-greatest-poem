IN THE REALM OF ELEMENTS AND LORE SO WIDE,  
THREE ENTITIES IN BALANCE STRIDE.  
SODIUM CHLORIDE, WITH ITS CRYSTAL GRACE,  
SEASONING LIFE, A FAMILIAR EMBRACE.

CHLORINE, FIERCE WITH A POTENT STING,  
PURIFIES WATERS, AN UNSEEN KING.  
BOTH BORN OF NATURE, YET DISTINCT IN ROLE,  
ONE BRINGS FLAVOR, THE OTHER CONTROLS.

MIDICHLORIANS, FROM A GALAXY FAR,  
BRIDGE LIFE AND FORCE, A GUIDING STAR.  
NOT OF THIS EARTH, BUT IN EVERY CELL,  
THEY WHISPER SECRETS, A MYSTICAL SPELL.

THOUGH DIFFERENT REALMS THEY EACH RESIDE,  
IN THEIR ESSENCE, CONNECTIONS ABIDE.  
ELEMENTS AND MYTHS, DIVERSE YET ALIGNED,  
IN THE FABRIC OF LIFE, THEIR THREADS ENTWINED.
